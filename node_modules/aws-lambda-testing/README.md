aws-lambda-testing for JavaScript

# Installing

```bash
$ npm install aws-lambda-testing
```

# Getting starter

```js

let AwsTest = require( 'aws-lambda-testing' )
let awsTest = new AwsTest() // you can pass a handler.
let handler = function (params, ctx, cb) {
  //the handler receive the params, ctx and cb
  assert(params.test === 'test')
  ctx.done(null, 'test') // the ctx object has the method done, fail and success
}
awsTest.setHandler(handler)
.exec({test: 'test'},function (error, res) { // The exec function can receive the params and callback
  // to use in the hadler to test
  assert(!error)
  assert(res === 'test')
})

awsTest.setHandler(handler)
.exec({test: 'testing the promise'}) // if you do not pass a callback return a promise
.then(function (res) {
  assert(res === 'testing the promise')
})
.catch(errorHandler) // every error is catched and the promise is rejected
})
```
### `Class aws-lambda-testing`
#### `aws-lambda-testing([handler, params, cb, ctx])`
To instance the aws-lambda-testing you can pass the handler to test, the params and callback to be
used when the handler is execed and the context to be used to exec it.

### `Instance aws-lambda-testing`
#### `aws-lambda-testing.exec([params,callback]) => self || promise`
This method exec the handler and return a promise, this promise is resolve with the return valur of callback passed to this
function and rejected with every error catched or values passed to ctx.fail or ctx.done. If you do not pass a callback return a promise.
If process is over timeout or memory usage limit a error is return in callback or promise.
##### `Event pre config`

There event preconfig to use, if params is a string and equal to:

```js
[ '$CloudFormationCreateRequest',
  '$SESEmailReceiving',
  'ScheduledEvent',
  '$CloudWatchLogs',
  '$SNS',
  '$DynamoDBUpdate',
  '$CognitoSyncTrigger',
  '$KinesisStreams',
  '$S3Put',
  '$S3Delete',
  '$Lex',
  '$GatewayProxyRequest',
  '$GatewayProxyResponse',
  '$CloudFront',
  '$Config',
  '$IoTButton',
  '$KinesisFirehose' ]
```
#### `aws-lambda-testing.setHandler(handler) => self`
This method setted the handler to be tested and return itself instance.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.setParams(params) => self`
This method setted the params to be passed to the handler and return itself instance.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.setcallback(callback) => self`
This method setted the callback to be passed to the handler and return itself instance.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.setCtx(ctx) => self`
This method setted the context to be passed like thisArg to the handler and return itself instance.

#### `aws-lambda-testing.setTimeout(timeout)`
This method setted the timeout, if the timeout in exec is broken a error is throw and passed to callback or promise if is not managed.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.getMemoryUsage() => Number (MB unit)`
get the memory usage by last process.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.setMemoryUsageLimit(Number limit (MB unit)) => self`
set the memory usage limit, if any exec routine is over this limit a error is returned in callback or promise.
#### `aws-lambda-testing.getMemoryUsageLimit() => Number (MB unit)`
get the memory limit, default is infinity
#### `aws-lambda-testing.memoryUsageIsOverLimit() => Boolean`
get if memory usage limit is over.
#### `Ctx object`
The ctx object has the method done, success and fail. If the error or error like
passed to done or fail method is not controlled by the callback is passed to reject method.
# Testing

Running the tests
